Startup:
-Use "make run" to compile 
-to run the program use "./server" to start the server,
    "./sender <hostname> 33490" to start a sender,
    "./client <hostname> 34950" to start a receiver
-Use "make clean" to remove executables when finished

Summary of functionality:
-Sender: once initiated can send a message to all of the receivers available. Multiple senders can be active at once and they are all able to send to the receivers.
-Receiver: displays a message sent from any sender, along with where the message came from.
-Server: Connects to the senders and receivers to facilitate the sending of messages.

Tests run:
    -tested if server can handle >1 sender.
    -tested if server will send messages to >1 receiver.
    -tested closing the senders and receivers.
    -tested closing the server.
    -tested sending over 100 characters.


Known issues: 
    -When closing senders, the server turns off.
    -when closing receivers, the server doesn't free that socket.
    -There is no buffer in place to hold messages if they are received simultaineously .
    -when the server is shut off, the senders and receivers continue running.
